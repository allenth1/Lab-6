Parks in Seattle

This map shows where all of the public parks in King County, Washington are located relative to census tract districts.  Each park is identified by a popup that describes the park itself, while also showing how parks coincide with how dense a population is in a certain district.  The data was obtained through Data.gov, with the census districts being retrieved from the King County GIS Public Data website.  Anyone who is visiting the Seattle area can explore this map and find the right park to take their kids to play while the parents relax.  It is also useful to find out which parks may potentially have less people crowding it, making a great picnic spot for the family.  The best part about this map is that it is not specific to a certain group of people, but rather all people who enjoy spending time outside.
